  "SECTION00010000000000000000">1 Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>This paper introduces the Creative Commons Rights Expression
  Language (ccREL), the standard recommended by Creative Commons
  (CC) for machine-readable expression of copyright licensing terms
  and related information.<a name="tex2html3" href="#foot548" id=
  "tex2html3"><sup>1</sup></a> ccREL and its description in this
  paper supersede all previous Creative Commons recommendations for
  expressing licensing metadata. Like CC's previous recommendation,
  ccREL is based on the World-Wide Web Consortium's Resource
  Description Framework (RDF).<a name="tex2html6" href="#foot549"
  id="tex2html6"><sup>2</sup></a>Compared to the previous
  recommendation, ccREL is intended to be both easier for content
  creators and publishers to provide, and more convenient for user
  communities and tool builders to consume, extend, and
  redistribute.<a name="tex2html8" href="#foot48" id=
  "tex2html8"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

  <p>Formally, ccREL is specified in an abstract syntax-free way,
  as an extensible set of properties to be associated with a
  licensed documents. Publishers have wide discretion in their
  choice of syntax, so long as the process for extracting the
  properties is discoverable and tool builders can retrieve the
  properties of ccREL-compliant Web pages or embedded documents. We
  also recommend specific concrete "default" syntaxes and
  embedding schemes for content creators and publishers who want to
  use CC licenses without needing to be concerned about extraction
  mechanisms. The default schemes are RDFa for HTML Web pages and
  resources referenced therein, and XMP for stand-alone
  media.<a name="tex2html9" href="#foot550" id=
  "tex2html9"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a name="SECTION00010010000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00010010000000000000">An Example.</a></h4>Using this new
  recommendation, an author can express Creative Commons structured
  data in an HTML page using the following simple markup:

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;div about="http://lessig.org/blog/" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"&gt;
    This page, by 
    &lt;a property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL"
          href="http://lessig.org/"&gt;
       Lawrence Lessig
    &lt;/a&gt;,
    is licensed under a
    &lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"&gt;
      Creative Commons Attribution License
    &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
  </p>

  <p>From this markup, tools can easily and
  reliably determine that <tt><a name="tex2html14" href=
  "http://lessig.org/blog/" id=
  "tex2html14">http://lessig.org/blog/</a></tt> is licensed under a
  CC Attribution License, v3.0, where attribution should be given

  Paper.</a></h4>
	<p>
		This paper explains the design
  rationale for these recommendations and illustrates some specific
  applications we expect ccREL to support. We begin with a review
  of the original 2002 recommendation for Creative Commons metadata
  and we explain why, as Creative Commons has grown, we have come
  to regard this as inadequate. We then introduce ccREL in the
  syntax-free model: as a vocabulary of properties. Next, we
  describe the recommended concrete syntaxes. In addition, we
  explain how other frameworks, such as microformats, can be made
  ccREL compliant. Finally, we discuss specific use cases and the
  types of tools we hope to see built to take advantage of
  ccREL.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00020000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00020000000000000000">2 Background on Creative Commons
  recommendations</a></h1>

  <p>Creative Commons was publicly launched in
  December 2002, but its genesis traces to summer 2000 and
  discussions about how to promote a reasonable and flexible
  copyright regime for the Internet in an environment where
  copyright had become unreasonable and inflexible. There was no
  standard legal means for creators to grant limited rights to the
  public for online material, and obtaining rights often required
  difficult searches to identify rights-holders and burdensome
  transaction costs to negotiate permissions. As digital networks
  dramatically lowered other costs and engendered new opportunities
  for producing, consuming, and reusing content, the inflexibility
  and costs of licensing became comparatively more
  onerous.</p>

  <p>Over the following year, Creative Commons'
  founders came to adopt a two-pronged response to this challenge.
  One prong was legal and social: create widely applicable licenses
  that permit sharing and reuse with conditions, clearly
  communicated in human-readable form. The other prong called for
  leveraging digital networks themselves to make licensed works
  more reusable and easy to find; that is, to lower search and
  transaction costs for works whose copyright holders have granted
  some rights to the public in advance. Core to this technical
  component is the ability for machines to detect and interpret the
  licensing terms as automatically as possible. Simple programs
  should thus be able to answer questions like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Under what license has a copyright holder released her
    work, and what are the associated permissions and
    restrictions?</li>

    <li>Can I redistribute this work for commercial purposes?</li>

    <li>Can I distribute a modified version of this work?</li>

    <li>How should I assign credit to the original author?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Equally important is constructing a robust
  user-machine bridge for publishing and detecting structured
  licensing information on the Web, and stimulating the emergence
  of tools that lower the barriers to collaboration and remixing.
  For example, if a Web page contains multiple images, not all
  licensed identically, can users easily determine which rights are
  granted on a particular image? Can they easily extract this
  image, create derivative works, and distribute them while
  assigning proper credit to the original author? In other words,
  is there a clear and usable connection between what the user sees
  and what the machine parses? ccREL aims to be a standard that
  implementors can follow in creating tools that make these
  operations simple.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00021000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00021000000000000000">2.1 Creative Commons and
  RDF</a></h2>

  <p>As early as fall 2001, Creative Commons had
  settled on the approach of creating machine-readable licenses
  based on the World Wide Web Consortium's then-emerging Resource
  Description Framework (RDF), part of the W3C Semantic Web
  Activity.<a name="tex2html16" href="#foot551" id=
  "tex2html16"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

  <p>The motivation for choosing RDF in 2001, and
  for continuing to use it now, is strongly connected to the
  Creative Commons vision: promoting scholarly and cultural
  progress by making it easy for people to share their creations
  and to collaborate by building on each other's work. In order to
  lower barriers to collaboration, it is important that the machine
  expression of licensing information and other metadata be
  <i>interoperable</i>. Interoperability here means not only that
  different programs can read particular metadata properties, but
  also that vocabularies--sets of related properties--can evolve
  and be extended. This should be possible in such a way that
  innovation can proceed in a distributed fashion in different
  communities--authors, musicians, photographers, cinematographers,
  biologists, geologists, an so on--so that licensing terms can be
  devised by local communities for types of works not yet
  envisioned. It is also important that potential extensions be
  backward compatible: existing tools should not be disrupted when
  new properties are added. If possible, existing tools should even
  be able to handle basic aspects of new properties. This is
  precisely the kind of "interoperability of meaning" that RDF is
  designed to support.</p>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00021100000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00021100000000000000">2.1.1 RDF triples</a></h3>

  <p>RDF is a framework for describing entities on
  the Web. It provides exceptionally strong support for
  interoperability and extensibility. All entities in RDF are named
  using a simple, distributed, globally addressable scheme already
  well known to Web users: the URL, and its generalization the
  URI.<a name="tex2html18" href="#foot66" id=
  "tex2html18"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

  <p>For example, Lawrence Lessig's blog, a
  document identified by its URL <tt><a name="tex2html19" href=
  "http://lessig.org/blog/" id=
  "tex2html19">http://lessig.org/blog/</a></tt>, is licensed under
  the Creative Commons Attribution license. That license is also a
  document, identified by its own URL <tt><a name="tex2html20"
  href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" id=
  "tex2html20">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a></tt>.
  The property of "being licensed under", which we'll call
  "license" can <i>itself</i> be considered a Web object and
  identified by a URL. This URL is <tt><a name="tex2html21" href=
  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license" id=
  "tex2html21">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license</a></tt>,
  which refers to a Web page that contains information describing
  the "license" property. This particular Web page, maintained by
  the Web Consortium, is the reference document that describes the
  vocabulary supported as part of the Web standard XHTML
  language.<a name="tex2html22" href="#foot552" id=
  "tex2html22"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

  <p>Instantiating properties as URLs enables
  anyone to use those properties to formulate descriptions, or to
  discover detailed information about an existing property by
  consulting the page at the URL, or to make new properties
  available simply by publishing the URLs that describe those
  properties.</p>

  <p>As a case in point, Creative Commons
  originally defined its own "license" property, which it
  published at <tt><a name="tex2html24" href=
  "http://creativecommons.org/ns#license" id=
  "tex2html24">http://creativecommons.org/ns#license</a></tt>,<a name="tex2html25"
  href="#foot553" id="tex2html25"><sup>8</sup></a>since no other
  group had defined in RDF the concept of a copyright license. When
  the XHTML Working Group introduced its own license property in
  2005, we opted to start using their version, rather than maintain
  our own CC-dependent notion of license. We were then able to
  declare that <tt><a name="tex2html32" href=
  "http://creativecommons.org/ns#license" id=
  "tex2html32">http://creativecommons.org/ns#license</a></tt> is
  equivalent to the new property <tt><a name="tex2html33" href=
  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license" id=
  "tex2html33">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#license</a></tt>,
  simply by updating the description at <tt><a name="tex2html34"
  href="http://creativecommons.org/ns#license" id=
  "tex2html34">http://creativecommons.org/ns#license</a></tt>.
  Importantly, RDF makes this equivalence interpretable by
  programs, not just humans, so that "old" RDF license
  declarations can be automatically interpreted using the new
  vocabulary.</p>

  <p>In general, atomic RDF descriptions are called
  <em>triples</em>. Each triple consists of a <i>subject</i>, a
  <i>property</i>, and a <i>value</i> for that property of the
  subject. The triple that describes the license for Lessig's blog
  could be represented graphically as shown in figure <a href=
  "#fig:rdftriple">1</a>: a point (the subject) labeled with the
  blog URL, a second point (the value) labeled with the license
  URL, and an arrow (the property) labeled with the URL that
  describes the meaning of the term "license", running from the
  blog to the license. In general, an RDF model, as a collection of
  triples, can be visualized as a graph of relations among
  elements, where the edges and vertices are all labeled using
  URIs.</p>

  "SECTION00021200000000000000">2.1.2 Expressing RDF as
  text</a></h3>

  <p>Abstract RDF graphs can be expressed textually
  in various ways. One commonly used notation, RDF/XML, uses XML
  syntax. In RDF/XML the triple describing the licensing of
  Lessig's blog is denoted:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
            xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#"&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://www.lessig.org/blog/"&gt;
     &lt;xhtml:license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" /&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
  </p>

  <p>One desirable feature of
  RDF/XML notation is that it is completely self-contained: all
  identifiers are fully qualified URLs. On the other hand, RDF/XML
  notation is extremely verbose, making it cumbersome for people to
  read and write, especially if no shorthand conventions are used.
  Even this simple example (verbose as it is) uses a shorthand
  mechanism: the second line of the description beginning
  <tt>xmlns:xhtml</tt> defines "<tt>xhtml:</tt>" to be an
  abbreviation for <tt><a name="tex2html36" href=
  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#" id=
  "tex2html36">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#</a></tt>, thus
  expressing the <tt>license</tt> property in its shorter form,
  <tt>xhtml:license</tt>, on the fourth line.</p>

  <p>Since the introduction of RDF,
  the Web Consortium has developed more compact alternative
  syntaxes for RDF graphs. For example the N3 syntax would denote
  the above triple more concisely:<a name="tex2html37" href=
  "#foot554" id="tex2html37"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt;
  &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml#license&gt;
  &lt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&gt; .
  </p>

  <p>We could also
  rewrite this using a shorthand as in the RDF/XHTML example above,
  defining: <tt>xhtml:</tt> as an abbreviation for <tt><a name=
  "tex2html39" href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#" id=
  "tex2html39">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#</a></tt>:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
@prefix xhtml: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#&gt;
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; xhtml:license &lt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&gt; .
  </p>

  <p>The shorthand does not provide improved compactness or
  readability if a prefix is only used once as above, of course. In
  N3, prefixes are typically defined only when they are used more
  than once, for example to express multiple properties taken from
  the same vocabulary. In RDF/XML, because of the stricter parsing
  rules of XML, there is a bit less flexibility: predicates can
  only be expressed using the shorthand, while subjects can only be
  expressed using the full URI.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00022000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00022000000000000000">2.2 CC's Previous Recommendation:
  RDF/XML in HTML Comments</a></h2>

  <p>With its first unveiling of machine-readable licenses in
  2002, Creative Commons recommended that publishers use the
  RDF/XML syntax to express license properties. The CC web site
  included a Web-based license generator, where publishers could
  answer a questionnaire to indicate what kind of license they
  wished, and the generator then provided RDF/XML text for them to
  include on their Web pages, inside HTML comments: 
  </p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;!-- [RDF/XML HERE] --&gt;
  </p>

  <p>We knew at the time that this was a cumbersome design, but
  there was little alternative. RDF/XML, despite its verbosity, was
  the only standard syntax for expressing RDF. Worse, the Web
  Consortium's Semantic Web Activity was focused on providing
  organizations with ways to annotate databases for integration
  into the Web, and it paid scant attention to the issues of
  intermixing semantic information with visible Web elements. A
  task force had been formed to address these issues, but there was
  no W3C standard for including RDF in HTML
  pages.</p>

  <p>One consequence of CC's limited initial design is that,
  although millions of Web pages now include Creative Commons
  licenses and metadata, there is no uniform, extensible way for
  tool developers to access this metadata, and the tools that do
  exist rely on ad-hoc techniques for extracting
  metadata.</p>

  <p>Since 2004, Creative Commons has been working with the Web
  Consortium to create more straightforward and less limited
  methods of embedding RDF in HTML documents. These new methods are
  now making their way through the W3C standards process.
  Accordingly,</p>

  <blockquote>
    <i>Creative Commons no longer recommends using RDF/XML in
    HTML comments for specifying licensing information. This paper
    supersedes that recommendation.</i>
  </blockquote>

  <p>We hope that the new ccREL standard presented in this paper
  will result in a more consistent and stable platform for
  publishers and tool builders to build upon Creative Commons
  licenses.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00030000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00030000000000000000">3 The ccREL Abstract Model</a></h1>

  <p>This section describes ccREL, Creative Commons' new
  recommendation for machine-readable licensing information, in its
  abstract form, i.e., independent of any concrete syntax. As an
  abstract specification, ccREL consists of a small but extensible
  set of RDF properties that should be provided with each licensed
  object. This abstract specification has evolved since the
  original introduction of CC properties in 2002, but it is worth
  noting that all first-generation licenses are still correctly
  interpretable against the new specification, thanks in large part
  to the extensibility properties of RDF
  itself.</p>

  <p>The abstract model for ccREL distinguishes two classes of
  properties:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><i>Work properties</i> describe aspects of specific
    works,<br />
    including under which license a Work is distributed.</li>

    <li><i>License properties</i> describe aspects of
    licenses.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Publishers will normally be concerned only with Work
  properties: this is the only information publishers provide to
  describe a Work's licensing terms. License properties are used by
  Creative Commons itself to define the authoritative
  specifications of the licenses we offer. Other organizations are
  free to use these components for describing their own licenses.
  Such licenses, although related to Creative Commons licenses,
  would not themselves be Creative Commons licenses nor would they
  be endorsed necessarily by Creative
  Commons.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00031000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00031000000000000000">3.1 Work Properties</a></h2>

  <p>A publisher who wishes to license a Work under a Creative
  Commons license must, at a minimum, provide one RDF triple that
  specifies the value of the Work's <tt>license</tt> property
  (i.e., the license that governs the Work), for
  example</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; xhtml:license &lt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&gt; .
  </p>

  <p>Although this is the minimum amount of
  information, Creative Commons also encourages publishers to
  include additional triples giving information about licensed
  works: the title, the name and URL for assigning attribution, and
  the document type. An example might
  be</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; dc:title "The Lessig Blog" .
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; cc:attributionName "Larry Lessig" .
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; cc:attributionURL &lt;http://lessig.org/&gt; .
&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; dc:type dcmitype:Text .
  </p>

  <p>The specific work properties
  illustrated here
  are</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>dc:title</tt> - the document's title. Here <tt>dc:</tt>
    is shorthand for the Dublin Core vocabulary defined at
    <tt><a name="tex2html40" href=
    "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" id=
    "tex2html40">http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</a></tt> and
    maintained by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.<a name=
    "tex2html41" href="#foot555" id=
    "tex2html41"><sup>10</sup></a></li>

    <li><tt>cc:attributionName</tt> - the name to cite when giving
    attribution when the work is modified or redistributed under
    the terms of the associated Creative Commons license.<a name=
    "tex2html43" href="#foot556" id="tex2html43"><sup>11</sup></a>
    The prefix <tt>cc:</tt>, as mentioned above, is an abbreviation
    for <tt><a name="tex2html44" href=
    "http://creativecommons.org/ns#" id=
    "tex2html44">http://creativecommons.org/ns#</a></tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:attributionURL</tt> - the URL to link to when
    providing attribution.</li>

    <li><tt>dc:type</tt> - the type of the licensed document. In
    this example, the associated value is <tt>dcmitype:Text</tt>,
    which indicates text. Lessig's blog sometimes includes video,
    in which case the type would be <tt>dcmitype:MovingImage</tt>.
    Recommended use of <tt>dc:type</tt> is explained at
    <tt><a name="tex2html45" href=
    "http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/" id=
    "tex2html45">http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/</a></tt>.
    Individual types like <tt>dcmitype:Text</tt> and
    <tt>dcmitype:MovingImage</tt> are part of the DCMI
    Vocabulary.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Incidentally, the above list
  of four triples could be alternately expressed using the N3
  semicolon convention, which indicates a list of triples that all
  have the same
  subject:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
@prefix dc: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&gt;
@prefix cc: &lt;http://creativecommons.org/ns#&gt;
@prefix dcmitype: &lt;http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/&gt;

&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt;
    dc:title "The Lessig Blog" ;
    cc:attributionName "Larry Lessig" ;
    cc:attributionURL &lt;http://lessig.org/&gt; ;
    dc:type dcmitype:Text .
  </p>

  <p>There are two more Work
  properties available to publishers of CC
  material:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <tt>dc:source</tt>--indicates the original source of modified
      work, specified as a URI, for example

      <p class="codeblock">
&lt;http://randomblog.org/modified_lessig_presentation&gt; dc:source &lt;http://lessig.org/&gt; .
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <tt>cc:morePermissions</tt>--indicates a URL that gives
      information on additional permissions beyond those specified
      in the CC license. For example, a document with a CC license
      that requires attribution, might, under certain
      circumstances, be usable without attribution. Or a document
      restricted for noncommercial use could be available for
      commercial use under certain conditions.

      <p>A typical use would then be:</p>

      <p class="codeblock">
&lt;http://randomblog.org/insightful_posting&gt;
   cc:morePermissions &lt;http://randomblog.org/attribution_free_licensing&gt; .
      </p>

      <p>The information at the designated URL is
      completely up to the publisher, as are the terms of the
      associated additional permissions, with one proviso: The
      additional permissions must be <em>additional</em>
      permissions, i.e., they cannot restrict the rights granted by
      the Creative Commons license. Said another way, any use of
      the work that is valid without taking the morePermissions
      property into account, must remain valid after taking
      morePermissions into account.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is the
  current set of ccREL Work properties. New properties may be added
  over time, defined by Creative Commons or by others. Observe that
  ccREL inherits the underlying extensibility of RDF--all that is
  required to create new properties is to include additional
  triples that use these. For example, a community of photography
  publishers could agree to use an additional
  <tt>photoResolution</tt> property, and this would not disrupt the
  operation of pre-existing tools, so long as the old properties
  remain available. We'll see below that the concrete syntax (RDFa)
  recommended by Creative Commons for ccREL enjoys this same
  extensibility
  property.</p>

  <p>Distributed
  creation of new properties notwithstanding, only Creative Commons
  can include new elements in the <tt>cc:</tt> namespace, because
  Creative Commons controls the defining document at <tt><a name=
  "tex2html46" href="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" id=
  "tex2html46">http://creativecommons.org/ns#</a></tt>. This
  ability to retain this kind of control, without loss of
  extensibility, is a direct consequence of using
  RDF.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00032000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00032000000000000000">3.2 License
  Properties</a></h2>

  <p>We now
  consider properties used for describing Licenses. With ccREL,
  Creative Commons does not expect publishers to use these license
  properties directly, or even to deal with them at
  all.</p>

  <p>In contrast,
  Creative Commons' original metadata recommendation encouraged
  publishers to provide the license properties with every licensed
  work. This design was awkward, because once a publisher has
  already indicated which license governs the Work, specifying the
  license properties in addition is redundant and thus error prone.
  The ccREL recommendation does away with this duplication and
  leaves it to Creative Commons to provide the license
  properties.</p>

  <p>Tool
  builders, on the other hand, should take these License properties
  into account so that they can interpret the particulars of each
  Creative Commons license. The License properties governing a Work
  will typically be found by URL-based discovery. A tool examining
  a Work notices the <tt>xhtml:license</tt> property and follows
  the indicated link to a page for the designated license. Those
  license description pages--the "Creative Commons Deeds"-- are
  maintained by Creative Commons, and include the license
  properties in the CC recommended concrete syntax (RDFa), as
  described in section <a href=
  "#deed-RDFa">7.2</a>:</p>

  <p>Here are the
  License properties defined as part of
  ccREL:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>cc:permits</tt> - permits a particular
    use of the Work above and beyond what default copyright law
    allows.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:prohibits</tt> - prohibits a
    particular use of the Work, specifically affecting the scope of
    the permissions provided by <tt>cc:permits</tt> (but not
    reducing rights granted under copyright).</li>

    <li><tt>cc:requires</tt> - requires certain
    actions of the user when enjoying the permissions given by
    <tt>cc:permits</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:jurisdiction</tt> - associates the
    license with a particular legal jurisdiction.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:deprecatedOn</tt> - indicates that
    the license has been deprecated on the given date.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:legalCode</tt> - references the
    corresponding legal text of the license.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Importantly,
  Creative Commons does not allow third parties to modify these
  properties for existing Creative Commons licenses. That said,
  publishers may certainly use these properties to create new
  licenses of their own, which they should host on their own
  servers, and not represent as being Creative Commons
  licenses.</p>

  <p>The possible
  values for <tt>cc:permits</tt>, i.e., the possible permissions
  granted by a CC License
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>cc:Reproduction</tt> - copying the work
    in various forms.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:Distribution</tt> - redistributing
    the work.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:DerivativeWorks</tt> - preparing
    derivatives of the work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The possible
  values for <tt>cc:prohibits</tt>, i.e., possible prohibitions
  that modulate permissions (but do not affect permissions granted
  by copyright law, such as fair use)
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>cc:CommercialUse</tt> - using the Work
    for commercial purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The possible
  values for <tt>cc:requires</tt>
  are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>cc:Notice</tt> - providing an
    indication of the license that governs the work.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:Attribution</tt> - giving credit to
    the appropriate creator.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:ShareAlike</tt> - when
    redistributing derivative works of this work, using the same
    license.</li>

    <li><tt>cc:SourceCode</tt> - when
    redistributing this work (which is expected to be software when
    this requirement is used), source code must be
    provided.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example,
  the Attribution Share-Alike v3.0 Creative Commons license is
  described as:<a name="tex2html47" href="#foot557" id=
  "tex2html47"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

  <p class="codeblock">

  </p>

  <p>As new copyright licenses are introduced, Creative Commons
  expects to add new permissions, requirements, and prohibitions.
  However, it is unlikely that Creative Commons will introduce new
  license property types beyond <tt>permits</tt>,
  <tt>requires</tt>, and <tt>prohibits</tt>. As a result, tools
  built to understand these three property types will be able to
  interpret future licenses, at least by listing the license's
  permissions, requirements, and prohibitions: thanks to the
  underlying RDF framework of designating properties by URLs, these
  tools can easily discover human-readable descriptions of these
  as-yet-undefined property
  values.</p>

  <h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00040000000000000000">4 Desiderata for concrete ccREL
  syntaxes</a></h1>

  <p>While the previous examples illustrate ccREL using the
  RDF/XML and N3 notations, ccREL is meant to be independent of any
  particular syntax for expressing RDF triples. To create compliant
  ccREL implementations, publishers need only arrange that tool
  builders can extract RDF triples for the relevant ccREL
  properties--typically only the Work properties, since Creative
  Commons provides the License properties--through a discoverable
  process. We expect that different publishers will do this in
  different ways, using syntaxes of their choice that take into
  account the kinds of environments they would like to provide for
  their users. In each case, however, it is the publisher's
  responsibility to associate their pages with appropriate
  extraction mechanisms and to arrange for these mechanisms to be
  discoverable by tool
  builders.</p>

  <p>Creative Commons also recommends concrete ccREL syntaxes
  that tool builders should recognize by default, so that
  publishers who do not want to be explicitly concerned with
  extraction mechanisms have a clear implementation path. These
  recommended syntaxes--RDFa for HTML Web pages, and XMP for
  free-floating content--are described in the following sections.
  This section presents the principles underlying our
  recommendations.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00041000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00041000000000000000">4.1 Principles for
  HTML</a></h2>

  <p>Licensing information for a Web document will be expressed
  in some form of HTML. What properties would an ideal HTML syntax
  for expressing Creative Commons terms exhibit? Given the use
  cases we've observed over the past several years, we can call out
  the following
  desiderata:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Independence and Extensibility</b>: We
    cannot know in advance what new kinds of data we will want to
    integrate with Creative Commons licensing data. Currently, we
    already need to combine Creative Commons properties with simple
    media files (sound, images, videos) and there's a growing
    interest in providing markup for complex scientific data
    (biomedical records, experimental results). Therefore, the
    means of expressing the licensing information in HTML should be
    extensible: it should enable the reuse of existing data models
    and the addition of new properties, both by Creative Commons
    and by others. Adding new properties should not require
    extensive coordination across communities or approval from a
    central authority. Tools should not suddenly become obsolete
    when new properties are added, or when existing properties are
    applied to new kinds of data sets.</li>

    <li><b>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</b>: An HTML
    document often already displays the name of the author and a
    clickable link to a Creative Commons license. Providing
    machine-readable structure should not require duplicating this
    data in a separate format. Notably, if the human-clickable link
    to the license is changed, e.g. from v2.5 to v3.0, a machine
    processing the page should automatically note this change
    without the publisher having to update another part of the HTML
    file to keep it "in sync" with the human-readable
    portion.</li>

    <li><b>Visual Locality</b>: An HTML page may
    contain multiple items, for example a dozen photos, each with
    its own structured data, for example a different license. It
    should be easy for tools to associate the appropriate
    structured data with their corresponding visual
    display.</li>

    <li><b>Remix Friendliness</b>: It should be
    easy to copy an item from one document and paste it into a new
    document with all appropriate structured data included. In a
    world where we constantly remix old content to create new
    content, copy-and-paste, widgets, and sidebars are crucial
    elements of the remixable Web. As much as possible, ccREL
    should allow for easy copy-and-paste of data to carry along the
    appropriate licensing information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00042000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00042000000000000000">4.2 Desiderata for Free-Floating
  Content</a></h2>

  <p>Some important works are not typically conveyed via HTML.
  Examples are MP3s, MPEGs, and other media files. The technique
  for embedding licensing data into these files should achieve the
  following design
  principles:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Consistency</b>: There are many
    different possible file types. The mechanism for embedding
    licensing information should be reasonably generic, so that a
    single tool can read and write the licensing information
    without requiring awareness of all file types.</li>

    <li><b>Publisher Accountability</b>: It can be
    difficult to provide for accountability of licensing metadata
    when files are shared in peer-to-peer systems, rather than
    distributed from a central location. The method for expressing
    metadata should facilitate providing publisher accountability
    at least as strong as the accountability of a Web page with a
    well-defined host and owner.</li>

    <li><b>Simplicity</b>: The process of embedding
    licensing information should require little more than a simple
    and free program. In particular, though complex publisher
    accountability approaches involving digital signatures and
    certificates can be used, they should not be required for the
    basic use case.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Consider the abstract model for ccREL. Here, again, are the

&lt;http://lessig.org/blog/&gt; cc:attributionURL &lt;http://lessig.org/&gt; .
  </p>

  <p>The Web page to which this information
  refers typically already contains some HTML that describes this
  same information (redundantly), in human-readable form, for
  example:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;a href="http://lessig.org/"&gt;

      Creative Commons Attribution License
  &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
  </p>

  <p>What we would like is a way to quickly
  augment this HTML with just enough structure to enable the
  extraction of the RDF triples, using the principles articulated
  above, including, notably, Don't Repeat Yourself: the existing
  markup and links should be used both for human and machine
  readability.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00051000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00051000000000000000">5.1 RDFa and concrete syntax for
  Work properties</a></h2>

  <p>RDFa was designed by the W3C with Creative
  Commons' input. The design was motivated in part by the
  principles noted above. Using existing HTML properties and a
  handful of new ones, RDFa enables a chunk of HTML to express RDF
  triples, reusing the content wherever possible. For example, the
  HTML above would be extended by including additional attributes
  within the HTML anchor tags as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;div about="" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"&gt;
  This page, by
  &lt;a property="cc:attributionName"
     rel="cc:attributionURL" href="http://lessig.org/"&gt;
        Lawrence Lessig
  &lt;/a&gt;,
  is licensed under a
  &lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"&gt;
    Creative Commons Attribution License
  &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;
  </p>

  <p>The rules for understanding
  the meaning of the above markup are as
  follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><tt>about</tt> defines the subject of all
    triples within the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt>. Here we have
    <tt>about=""</tt>, which defines the subject to be the URL of
    the current document.</li>

    <li><tt>xmlns:cc</tt> associates, throughout
    the <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt>, the prefix <tt>cc</tt> with the URL
    <tt><a name="tex2html49" href="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"
    id="tex2html49">http://creativecommons.org/ns#</a></tt>, much
    as N3 does with <tt>@prefix</tt>.</li>

    <li><tt>property</tt> generates a new triple
    with predicate <tt>cc:attributionName</tt>, and the text
    content of the element, in this case "Lawrence Lessig," as
    the object.</li>

    <li><tt>rel="cc:attributionURL"</tt> generates
    a new triple with predicate <tt>cc:attributionURL</tt>, and the
    URL in the <tt>href</tt> as the object.</li>

    <li><tt>rel="license"</tt> generates a new
    triple with predicate <tt>xhtml:license</tt>, as <tt>xhtml</tt>
    is the default prefix for reserved XHTML values like
    <tt>license</tt>. The object is given by the
    <tt>href</tt>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The fragment of HTML (within
  the <tt>div</tt>) is entirely self-contained (and thus
  remix-friendly). Its meaning would be preserved if it were copied
  and pasted into another Web page. The data's structure is local
  to the data itself: a human looking at the page could easily
  identify the structured data by pointing to the rendered page and
  finding the enclosing chunk of HTML. In addition, the clickable
  links and rendered author names gain semantic meaning without
  repeating the core data. Finally, as this is embedded RDF, the
  extensibility and independence properties of RDF vocabularies are
  automatically inherited: anyone can create a new vocabulary or
  reuse portions of existing
  vocabularies.</p>

  <p>Of course, one can continue
  to add additional data, both visible and structured. Figure
  <a href="#complexLessigBlogMarkup">2</a> shows a more complex
  example that includes all Work properties currently supported by
  Creative Commons, including how this HTML+RDFa would be rendered
  on a Web page. Notice how properties can be associated with HTML
  spans as well as anchors, or in fact with any HTML elements--see
  the RDFa specification for
  details.</p>

  <p>The examples in this section
  illustrate how publishers can specify Work properties. One can
  also use RDFa to express License properties. This is what
  Creative Commons does with the license description pages on its
  own site, as described below in section <a href=
  "#deed-RDFa">7.2</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="SECTION00052000000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00052000000000000000">5.2 Microformats</a></h2>

  <p>Microformats are a set of
  simple, open data formats "designed for humans first and
  machines second." They provide domain-specific syntaxes for
  annotating data in HTML. At the moment, the two widely deployed
  "compound" microformats annotate contact information (hCard)
  and calendar events (hCal). Of the "elemental" microformats,
  those meant to annotate a single data point, the most popular is
  <tt>rel-tag</tt>, used to denote a "tag" on an item, e.g. a
  blog post. Another elemental microformat is <tt>rel-license</tt>,
  which is meant to indicate the current page's license and which,
  conveniently, uses a syntax which overlaps with RDFa:
  <tt>rel="license"</tt>. Other microformats may, over time,
  integrate Creative Commons properties, for example when licensing
  images, videos, and other multimedia content.<a name="tex2html51"
  href="#foot559" id=
  "tex2html51"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

  <p>Microformat designers have
  focused on simplicity and readability, and Creative Commons
  encourages publishers who use microformats to make it easy for
  tool builders to extract the relevant ccREL triples. Nonetheless,
  microformats' syntactic simplicity comes at the cost of
  <i>independence and extensibility</i>, which makes them limited
  from the Creative Commons
  perspective.</p>

  <p>For example, every time a
  Creative Commons license needs to be expressed in a new
  context--e.g. videos instead of still images--a new microformat
  and syntax must be designed, and all parsers must then, somehow,
  become aware of the change. It is also not obvious how one might
  combine different microformats on a single Web page, given that
  the syntax rules may differ and even conflict from one
  microformat to the next.<a name="tex2html53" href="#foot560" id=
  "tex2html53"><sup>15</sup></a> Finally, when it comes time to
  express complex data sets with ever expanding sets of properties,
  e.g., scientific data, microformats do not appear to scale
  appropriately, given their lack of vocabulary scoping and general
  inability to mix vocabularies from independently developed
  sources--the kind of mixing that is enabled by RDF's use of
  namespaces.</p>

  <p>Thus, Creative Commons does
  not recommend any particular microformat syntax for ccREL, but we
  do recommend a method for ensuring that, when publishers use
  microformats, tool builders can extract the corresponding ccREL
  properties: use an appropriate profile URL in the header of the
  HTML document.<a name="tex2html55" href="#foot275" id=
  "tex2html55"><sup>16</sup></a>This profile URL significantly
  improves the independence and extensibility of microformats by
  ensuring that the tools can find the appropriate parser code for
  extracting the ccREL abstract model from the microformat, without
  having to know about all microformats in advance. One downside is
  that the microformat syntax then becomes less remix-friendly,
  with two disparate fragments: one in the head to declare the
  profile, and one in the body to express the data. Even so, the
  profile approach is likely good enough for simple data. It is
  worth noting that this use of a profile URL is already
  recommended as part of microformats' best practices, though it is
  unfortunately rarely implemented today in deployed
  applications.</p>

  "SECTION00053000000000000000">5.3 GRDDL for XML
  Documents</a></h2>

  <p>Not all documents on the web
  are HTML: one popular syntax for representing structured data in
  XML. Given that XML is a machine-readable syntax, often with a
  strict schema depending on the type of data expressed, not all of
  the principles we outlined are useful here. In particular,
  <i>visual locality</i> is not relevant when the reader is a
  machine rather than a human, and <i>remix-friendliness</i>
  doesn't really apply when XML fragments are rarely remixable in
  the first place, given schema validation. Thus, we focus on
  <i>independence and extensibility</i>, as well as
  <i>DRY</i>.</p>

  <p>When publishing Creative
  Commons licensing information inside an XML document, Creative
  Commons recommends exposing a mechanism to extract the ccREL
  abstract model from the XML, so that Creative Commons tools need
  not know about every possible XML schema ahead of time. The W3C's
  GRDDL recommendation performs exactly this task by letting
  publishers specify, either in each XML document or once in an XML
  schema, an XSL Transformation that extracts RDF/XML from
  XML.<a name="tex2html56" href="#foot561" id=

  Initiative, defines a complex XML schema for library
  resources.<a name="tex2html60" href="#foot563" id=
  "tex2html60"><sup>19</sup></a> These resources may include
  megabytes of data, including sometimes the entire resource in
  full text. Using XSLT, one can extract the relevant ccREL
  information, exactly as above. Using GRDDL, the Open Archives
  Initiative can specify the XSLT in its XML schema file, so that
  all OAI documents are automatically transformable to RDF/XML,
  which immediately conveys
  ccREL.</p>

  <h4><a name="SECTION00053010000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00053010000000000000">Direct RDF/XML embedding in
  XML.</a></h4>Interestingly, because RDF can be expressed using the
  RDF/XML syntax, one might be tempted to use RDF/XML directly
  inside an XML document with an appropriate schema definition that
  enables such direct embedding. This very approach is taken by
  SVG,<a name="tex2html62" href="#foot564" id=
  "tex2html62"><sup>20</sup></a> and there are cases of SVG
  graphics that include licensing information using directly
  embedded
  RDF/XML.

  <p>This approach can be made
  ccREL compliant with very little work--a simple GRDDL transform,
  declared in the XML schema definition, that extracts the RDF/XML
  and expresses it on its own. Note that, for ccREL compliance,
  this transform, although simple, is necessary. The reason for its
  necessity goes to the crux of the ccREL principles: without such
  a transform provided by each XML schema designer, tools would
  have to be aware of all the various XML schemas that include
  RDF/XML in this way. For extensibility and future-proofing, ccREL
  asks that publishers of the schema make the effort to provide the
  extraction mechanism. With explicit extraction mechanisms,
  publishers have a little bit more work to do, while tool builders
  are immediately empowered to create generic programs that can
  process data they have never seen
  before.</p>

  6 Embedding ccREL in Free-Floating Files</h1>

  <p>We turn to the precise
  Creative Commons recommendation for embedding ccREL metadata
  inside MP3s, Word documents, and other "free-floating" content
  that is often passed around in a peer-to-peer fashion, via email
  or P2P networks. We note that there are two distinct issues to
  resolve:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Expression:</em> expressing the
    abstract model using a specific syntax and embedding,
    and</li>

    <li><em>Accountability:</em> providing minimal
    accountability for the expressed ccREL data.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We handle accountability for
  free-floating content by connecting any free-floating document to
  a Web page, and placing the ccREL information on that Web page.
  Thus, publishers of free-floating content are just as accountable
  as publishers of Web-based content: rights are always expressed
  on a Web page. The connection between the Web page and the binary
  file it describes is achieved using a cryptographic hash, i.e. a
  fingerprint, of the file. For example, the PDF file of Lawrence
  Lessig's "Code v2" will contain a reference to <tt><a name=
  "tex2html64" href="http://codev2.cc/download+remix" id=
  "tex2html64">http://codev2.cc/download+remix</a></tt>, which
  itself will contain a reference to the SHA1 hash of the PDF file.
  The owner of the URL <tt><a name="tex2html65" href=
  "http://codev2.cc/download+remix" id=
  "tex2html65">http://codev2.cc/download+remix</a></tt> is thus
  taking responsibility for the ccREL statements it makes about the
  file.</p>

  <p>For expression, we recommend
  XMP. XMP has the broadest support of any embedded metadata format
  (perhaps it is the only such format with anything approaching
  broad support) across many different media formats. With the
  exception of media formats where a workable embedded metadata
  format is already ubiquitous (e.g. MP3), Creative Commons
  recommends adopting XMP as an embedded metadata standard and
  using the following two fields in
  particular:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Web reference: value of
    <tt>xapRights:WebStatement</tt></li>

    <li>License: value of
    <tt>cc:license</tt></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Consider our example of
  Lessig's "Code v2", a Creative Commons licensed,
  community-edited second version of his original "Code and Other
  Laws of Cyberspace." The PDF of this book, available at
  <tt><a name="tex2html66" href=
  "http://pdf.codev2.cc/Lessig-Codev2.pdf" id=
  "tex2html66">http://pdf.codev2.cc/Lessig-Codev2.pdf</a></tt>,
  contains XMP metadata as
  follows:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;?xpacket begin="" id=""?&gt;
&lt;x:xmpmeta xmlns:x="adobe:ns:meta/"&gt;
  &lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"&gt;

     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="" xmlns:xapRights="http://ns.adobe.com/xap/1.0/rights/"&gt;
        &lt;xapRights:Marked&gt;True&lt;/xapRights:Marked&gt;
        &lt;xapRights:WebStatement rdf:resource="http://codev2.cc/download+remix/" /&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

     ...

     &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"&gt;
        &lt;cc:license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" /&gt;
     &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

  &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
&lt;/x:xmpmeta&gt;
&lt;?xpacket end="r"?&gt;

  </p>

  <p>Notice how this is RDF/XML,
  including a <tt>xapRights:WebStatement</tt> pointer to the web
  page <tt><a name="tex2html67" href=
  "http://codev2.cc/download+remix/" id=
  "tex2html67">http://codev2.cc/download+remix/</a></tt>, which
  itself contains
  RDFa:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
Any derivative must be licensed under a
&lt;a about="urn:sha1:W4XGZGCD4D6TVXJSCIG3BJFLJNWFATTE"
   rel="license"
   href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/"&gt;
       Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.5 License
&lt;/a&gt;
  </p>

  <p>This RDFa references the PDF
  using its SHA1 hash--a secure fingerprint of the file that
  matches only the given PDF file--and declares its Creative
  Commons license. Thus, anyone that finds the "Code v2" PDF can
  find its <tt>WebStatement</tt> pointer, look up that URL, verify
  that it properly references the file via its SHA1 hash, and
  confirm the file's Creative Commons license on the web-based
  deed.</p>

  <p>Publishers can mix ccREL
  with other markup with great flexibility. Thanks to ccREL's
  <i>independence and extensibility</i> principle, publishers can
  use ccREL descriptions in combination with additional attributes
  taken from other publishers, or with entirely new attributes they
  define for their own purposes. Thanks to ccREL's <i>DRY</i>
  principle, even small publishers get the benefit of updating data
  in one location and automatically keeping the human- and
  machine-readable in

  Licenses</a></h3>

  <p>A common use case for Web
  publishers working in a mashup-friendly world is the issue of
  mixing content with different licenses. Consider, for example,
  what happens if Larry Lessig's blog reuses an image published by
  another author and licensed for non-commercial use. Recall that
  Lessig's Blog is licensed to permit commercial
  use.</p>

  <p>The HTML markup in this case
  is
  straightforward:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;div about="" xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#"&gt;
   This page, by
   &lt;a property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL"
      href="http://lessig.org/"&gt;
        Lawrence Lessig
   &lt;/a&gt;,

   &lt;a rel="license"
       href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"&gt;
         Creative Commons Attribution License
   &lt;/a&gt;.

   &lt;div about="/photos/constitution.jpg"&gt;
      The photo of the constitution used in this post was originally published by
      &lt;a rel="dc:source" href="http://example.org/"&gt;Joe Example&lt;/a&gt;, and is licensed under a
      &lt;a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/"&gt;
        Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License
      &lt;/a&gt;.
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

  <p>The inner
  <tt>&lt;div&gt;</tt> uses the <tt>about</tt> attribute to
  indicate that its statements concern the photo in question. A
  link to the original source is provided using the
  <tt>dc:source</tt> property, and a different license pointer is
  given for this photo using the normal anchor with a
  <tt>rel="license"</tt>
  attribute.</p>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00071200000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00071200000000000000">hAudio</a></h3>

  <p>Bitmunk is a service that
  supports artists with a legal, copyright-aware, content
  distribution service. The service needed a mechanism for
  embedding structured data about songs and albums directly into
  their web pages, including licensing information, so that browser
  add-ons might provide additional functionality around the music,
  e.g. comparing the price of a particular song at various online
  stores. Bitmunk first created a microformat called hAudio. They
  soon realized, however, that they would be duplicating fields
  when it came time to define hVideo, and that these duplicated
  fields would no longer be compatible with those of hAudio. More
  immediately problematic, hAudio's basic fields, e.g. title, would
  not be compatible with other "title" fields of other
  microformats.</p>

  <p>Thus, Bitmunk created the
  hAudio RDFa vocabulary. The design process for this vocabulary
  immediately revealed separate, logical components: Dublin Core
  for basic properties e.g. <tt>title</tt>, Creative Commons for
  licensing, a new vocabulary called "hMedia" for media-specific
  properties e.g. <tt>duration</tt>, and a new vocabulary called
  "hCommerce" for transaction-specific properties e.g.
  <tt>price</tt>. Bitmunk was thus able to reuse two existing
  vocabularies and add features. It was also able to clearly
  delineate logical components to make it particularly easy for
  other vocabulary developers to reuse only certain components of
  the hAudio vocabulary, e.g. hCommerce. Meanwhile, all Creative
  Commons licensing information is still expressible without
  alteration.</p>

  <p>Figure <a href=
  "#fig:bitmunk">3</a> shows an excerpt of the markup available
  from Bitmunk at <tt><a name="tex2html69" href=
  "http://bitmunk.com/view/media/6579151" id=
  "tex2html69">http://bitmunk.com/view/media/6579151</a></tt>. Note
  that this particular sample is not CC-licensed: it uses standard
  copyright. A CC-licensed album would be marked up in the same
  way, with a different <tt>license</tt> value: Bitmunk was able to
  develop its vocabulary independent of ccREL, and can now
  integrate with ccREL simply by adding the appropriate
  attributes.</p>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00071300000000000000" id=
  "SECTION00071300000000000000">Flickr</a></h3>

  <p>Flickr hosts approximately
  50 million CC-licensed images (as of October 2007). Currently
  Flickr denotes a license on each image's page with a link to the
  relevant license qualified by <tt>rel="license"</tt>. This ad-hoc
  convention, encouraged by the microformats effort, was
  "grandfathered" into RDFa thanks to the reserved HTML keyword
  <tt>license</tt>. Unfortunately, it works only for simple use
  cases, with a single image on a single page. This approach breaks
  down when multiple images are viewed on a single page, or when
  further information, such as the photographer's name, is
  required.</p>

  <p>Flickr could significantly
  benefit from the ccREL recommendations, by providing, in addition
  to simple license
  linking:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>License assertions scoped to the image
    being licensed.</li>

    <li>Attribution details.</li>

    <li>A <tt>cc:additionalPermissions</tt>
    reference to commercial licensing brokers and a
    <tt>dc:source</tt> reference to parent works.</li>

    <li>XMP embedding in images
    themselves.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition, Flickr recently
  deployed "machine tags," where photographers can add metadata
  about their images using custom properties. Flickr's machine tags
  are, in fact, a subset of RDF, which can be represented easily
  using RDFa. Thus, Creative Commons licensing can be easily
  expressed alongside Flickr's machine tags using the same
  technology, without
  interfering.</p>

  <p><em>Nature</em>, one of the
  world's top scientific journals, recently launched a web-only
  "precedings" site, where early results can be announced rapidly
  in advance of full-blown peer review. Papers on <em>Nature
  Precedings</em> are distributed under a Creative Commons license.
  Like Flickr, <em>Nature Precedings</em> currently uses CC's prior
  metadata recommendation: RDF/XML included in an HTML comment.
  Nature could significantly benefit from the ccREL recommendation,
  which would let them publish structured Creative Commons
  licensing information in a more robust, more extensible, and more
  human-readable
  way.</p>

  <p>Consider, for example, the
  Nature Preceding paper at <tt><a name="tex2html75" href=
  "http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1290/version/1" id=
  "tex2html75">http://precedings.nature.com/documents/1290/version/1</a></tt>.
  Figure <a href="#fig:nature">5</a> shows how the markup at that
  page can be extended with simple RDFa attributes, using the
  Dublin Core, Creative Commons, FOAF, and PRISM publication
  vocabularies.<a name="tex2html76" href="#foot568" id=
  "tex2html76"><sup>21</sup></a>Notice how any HTML element,
  including the existing <tt>H1</tt> used for the title, can be
  used to carry RDFa attributes. Figure <a href=
  "#fig:nature-precedings">6</a> shows how this page could appear
  in an RDFa-aware
  browser.</p>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00071500000000000000" id=

  <p>Open publication of
  scientific data on the Internet has begun, with the Nature
  Publishing Group recently announcing the release of genomic data
  sets under a Creative Commons license.<a name="tex2html78" href=
  "#foot569" id="tex2html78"><sup>22</sup></a> Beyond simple
  licensing, thousands of new metadata vocabularies and properties
  are being developed to express research results. Creative
  Commons, through its Science Commons subsidiary,<a name=
  "tex2html80" href="#foot570" id="tex2html80"><sup>23</sup></a> is
  playing an active role here, working to remove barriers to
  scientific cooperation and sharing. Science Commons is
  specifically encouraging the creation of RDF-based vocabularies
  for describing scientific information and is stimulating
  collaboration among research communities with tools that build on
  RDF's extensibility and
  interoperability.</p>

  </div>

  <p>As these vocabularies become
  more widespread, it's easy to envision uses of ccREL and RDFa
  that extend the bibliographic and licensing markup to include
  these new scientific data tags. Tools may then emerge to take
  advantage of this additional markup, enabling dynamic,
  distributed scientific collaboration through interoperable
  referencing of scientific
  concepts.</p>

  <p>Imagine, for example, an
  excerpt from a (hypothetical) Web-based newsletter about genomics
  research, which references an (actual) article from <em>BioMed
  Central Neurosciences</em>, as it might be rendered by a browser
  (Figure <a href="#figure:scientific-data-browser">7</a>). The
  words "recent study on rat brains", and "CEBP-beta" are
  clickable links, leading respectively, to a Web page for the
  paper, and a Web page that describes the protein CEBP-5#5 in the
  Uniprot protein
  database.</p>

  <p>The RDFa generating this
  excerpt could
  be</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;div
     xmlns:OBO_REL="http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ro.owl#"
     xmlns:UNIPROT="http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/"&gt;

   A &lt;a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2202/6/69"&gt;
      recent study on rat brains
   &lt;/a&gt;
   by von Gertten &lt;em&gt;et. al.&lt;/em&gt; reports that
 
   &lt;div about="http://purl.org/obo/owl/GO#GO_0050729"&gt;
     &lt;span property="rdfs:label"&gt;inflammatory stimuli&lt;/span&gt;
 
     upregulate expression of
 
     &lt;a rel="OBO_REL:precedes"
        href="http://purl.uniprot.org/uniprot/P17676"&gt;
       &lt;span property="rdfs:label"&gt;CEPB-beta&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</p>

  <p>This RDFa not only links to
  the paper in the usual way, but it also provides machine-readable
  information that this is a statement about inflammatory stimuli
  (as defined by the Open Biomedical Ontologies initiative)
  activating expression of the CEPB protein (as specified in the
  UniProt database of proteins). Since the URI of the protein is
  visually meaningful, it can be marked up with a clickable link
  that also provides the object of a
  triple.</p>

  "SECTION00071600000000000000">Additional
  Permissions</a></h3>

  <p>A CC license grants certain
  permissions to the public; others may be available privately. A
  coarse-grained "more permissions" link indicates this
  availability. Creative Commons has branded this scheme
  <b>CC+</b>. Also, since CC licenses are non-exclusive, other
  options for a work may be offered in addition to a CC license.
  Here is an example from <tt><a name="tex2html83" href=
  "http://magnatune.com" id=
  "tex2html83">http://magnatune.com</a></tt>, showing the use of
  RDFa to annotate the standard CC license image and also the
  Magnatune
  logo:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">
&lt;a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/1.0/" rel="license"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
  </p>

  <p>This snippet
  contains two statements: the public CC license and the
  availability of more permissions. Sophisticated users of this
  protocol will one day publish company, media, or genre-specific
  descriptions of the permissions available privately at the target
  URL. Tools built to recognize a Creative Commons license will
  still be able to detect the Creative Commons license after the
  addition of the <tt>morePermissions</tt> property, which is
  exactly the desired behavior. More sophisticated versions of the
  tools could inform the user that "more permissions" may be
  granted by following the indicated
  link.</p>

  7.2 Publishing license properties</h2>

  <p>As mentioned
  above, Creative Commons doesn't expect content publishers to deal
  with license properties. However, others may find themselves
  publishing licenses using ccREL's license properties. Here, too,
  RDFa is available as a framework for creating license
  descriptions that are human-readable, from which automated tools
  can also extract the required
  properties.</p>

  <p>One example
  of this is Creative Commons itself, and the publication of the
  "Commons Deeds". Figure <a href="#deed-figure">8</a> shows the
  HTML source of the Web page at <tt><a name="tex2html85" href=
  "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/" id=
  "tex2html85">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/us/</a></tt>
  which describes the U.S. version of the CC
  Attribution-NoDerivatives license. As this markup shows, any HTML
  attribute, including <tt>LI</tt>, can carry RDFa attributes. The
  <tt>href</tt> attribute, typically used for clickable links, can
  be used to indicate a structured relation, even when the element
  to which it is attached is not an HTML
  anchor.</p>

  <p>In this
  markup, the "Attribution-NoDerivatives" license permits
  distribution and reproduction, while requiring attribution and
  notice. Recall that ccREL is meant to be interpreted <i>in
  addition</i> to the baseline copyright regulation. In other
  words, the restriction "NoDerivatives" is not expressed in
  ccREL, since that is already a default in copyright law. The
  opposite, where derivative works <i>are</i> allowed, would be
  denoted with an additional CC
  permission.</p>

  <p>Tool
  builders who then want to extract RDF from this page can do so
  using, for example, the W3C's RDFa Distiller,<a name="tex2html86"
  href="#foot571" id="tex2html86"><sup>24</sup></a>which, when
  given the CC Deed URL <tt><a name="tex2html88" href=
  "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/" id=

  produces the RDF/XML serialization of the same structured data,
  ready to be imported into any programming language with RDF/XML
  support:</p>

  ccREL</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00073100000000000000" id=

  <p>MozCC<a name="tex2html89" href="#foot572" id=
  "tex2html89"><sup>25</sup></a> is an extension to Mozilla-based
  browsers for extracting and displaying metadata embedded in web
  pages. MozCC was initially developed in 2004 as a work-around to
  some of the deficiencies in the prior Creative Commons metadata
  recommendation. That version of MozCC specifically looked for
  Creative Commons RDF in HTML comments, a place most other parsers
  ignore. Once the metadata detected, MozCC provided users with a
  visual notification, via icons in the status bar, of the Creative
  Commons license. In addition, MozCC provided a simple interface
  to expose the work and license
  properties.</p>

  <p>Since the
  initial development, MozCC has been rewritten to provide general
  purpose extraction of all RDFa metadata, as well as a specialized
  interface for ccREL. The status-bar icons and detailed metadata
  visualization features have been preserved and expanded. A MozCC
  user receives immediate visual cues when he encounters a page
  with RDFa metadata, including specific CC-branded icons when the
  metadata indicates the presence of a Creative Commons license.
  The experience is pictured in Figure <a href=
  "#figure:mozcc">9</a>.</p>

  </div>

  <p>MozCC
  processes pages by listening for load events and then calling one
  or more metadata extractors on the content. Metadata extractors
  are JavaScript classes registered on browser startup; they may be
  provided by MozCC or other extensions. MozCC ships with
  extractors for all current and previous Creative Commons metadata
  recommendations, in particular ccREL. Each registered extractor
  is called for every page. The extractors are passed information
  about the page to be processed, including the URL and whether the
  page has changed since it was last processed. This allows
  individual extractors to determine whether re-processing is
  needed. The RDFa extractor, for example, can stop processing if
  it sees the document hasn't been updated. An extractor which
  looks for metadata specified in external files via
  <tt>&lt;link&gt;</tt> tags, however, would still retrieve them
  and see if they have been
  updated.</p>

  <p>The results
  of each extractor are stored in a local metadata store. In the
  case of Firefox, this is a SQLite database stored as part of the
  user's profile. The local metadata store serves as an abstraction
  layer between the extractors and user interface code. The
  contents are visible through the Page Info interface. The current
  software only exposes this information as status bar icons; one
  can imagine other user interfaces (provided by MozCC or other
  extensions) which expose the metadata in different
  ways.</p>

  <h3><a name="SECTION00073200000000000000" id=

  <p>Operator<a name="tex2html92" href="#foot573" id=
  "tex2html92"><sup>26</sup></a>is an add-on to the Firefox browser
  that detects microformats and RDFa in the web pages a user
  visits. Operator can be extended with "action scripts" that are
  triggered by specific data found in the web page. The regions of
  the page that contain data are themselves highlighted so that
  users can visually detect and receive contextual information
  about the
  data.</p>

  <p>It is
  relatively straight-forward to write a Creative Commons action
  script that finds all Creative Commons licensed content inside a
  web page by looking for the RDFa syntax. This allows users to
  easily identify their rights and responsibilities when reusing
  content they find on the web. No matter the item, even types of
  items with properties currently unanticipated, the simple action
  script can detect them, display the item's name and rights
  description.</p>

  <p>Putting
  aside for now the definition of some utility functions, an action
  handler for the license property is declared as follows:<a name=
  "tex2html94" href="#foot574" id=
  "tex2html94"><sup>27</sup></a></p>

  <p class="codeblock">
RDFa.DEFAULT_NS.cc = "http://creativecommons.org/ns#";
RDFa.ns.cc = function(name) { return RDFa.DEFAULT_NS.cc + name; };

var view_license = {
    description: "View License",
    shortDescription: "View",
    scope: {
        semantic: {
            "RDF": {
                property : RDFa.ns.cc("license"),
                defaultNS : RDFa.ns.cc("")
            }
        }
    },
    doAction: function(semanticObject, semanticObjectType, propertyIndex) {
        if (semanticObjectType == "RDF") {
            return semanticObject.license;
        }
    }
};

SemanticActions.add("view_license", view_license);
  </p>

  <p>Once this
  action script enabled, Operator automatically lights up Creative
  Commons licensed "Resources" it finds on the web. For example,
  browsing to the Lessig blog, Operator highlights two resources
  that are CC-licensed: the Lessig Blog itself, and a Creative
  Commons licensed photo used in one of the blog posts. The result
  is shown in Figure <a href=
  "#figure:operator">10</a>.</p>

  <p>Creative
  Commons wants to make it easy for artists and scientists to build
  upon the works of others when they choose to: licensing your work
  for reuse and finding properly licensed works to reuse should be
  easy. To achieve this on the technical front, we have defined
  ccREL, an abstract model for rights expression based on the W3C's
  RDF, and we recommend two syntaxes for web-based and
  free-floating content: RDFa and XMP, respectively. The major goal
  of our technological approach is to make it easy to publish and
  read rights expression data now and in the future, when the kinds
  of licensed items and the data expressed about them goes far
  beyond what we can imagine today. By using RDF, ccREL links
  Creative Commons to the fast-growing RDF data interoperability
  infrastructure and its extensive developer toolset: other data
  sets can be integrated with ccREL, and RDF technologies, e.g.
  data provenance with digital signatures, can eventually benefit
  ccREL.</p>

  <p>We believe
  that the technologies we have selected for ccREL will enable the
  kind of powerful, distributed technological innovation that is
  characteristic of the Internet. Anyone can create new
  vocabularies for their own purposes and combine them with ccREL
  as they please, without seeking central approval. Just as we did
  with the legal text of the licenses, we aim to create the minimal
  infrastructure required to enable collaboration and invention,
  while letting it flourish as an organic, distributed process. We
  believe ccREL provides this primordial technical layer that can
  enable a vibrant application ecosystem, and we look forward to
  the community's innovative ideas that can now freely build upon
  ccREL.</p>

    RDF/XML, described briefly below, is a method for expressing
    RDF in XML syntax. See "RDF/XML Syntax Specification

    <dd>The Semantic Web Activity is a large
    collaborative effort led by the W3C aimed at extending the Web
    to become a universal medium for data exchange, for programs as
    well as people. See <tt><a name="tex2html17" href=

    <dd>The term URI (universal resource
    identifier) is a generalization of URL (universal resource
    locator). While a URL refers in principle to a resource on the
    Web, a URI can designate anything named with this universal
    hierarchical naming scheme. This generality is used in ccREL
    for items such as downloaded media files.</dd>

    <dd>The full story is a little more
    complicated. CC initially used the <tt><a name="tex2html26"
    href="http://web.resource.org/cc/" id=
    "tex2html26">http://web.resource.org/cc/</a></tt> namespace,
    migrating to <tt><a name="tex2html27" href=
    "http://creativecommons.org/ns#" id=
    "tex2html27">http://creativecommons.org/ns#</a></tt> for
    superior human interaction with the vocabulary when it became
    apparent RDFa would facilitate this. In 2004 the Dublin Core
    Metadata Initiative approved a "license" refinement of its
    "rights" term (see <tt><a name="tex2html28" href=
